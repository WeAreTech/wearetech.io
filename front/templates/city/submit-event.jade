        p #{ city.hostname } is using a&nbsp;
          a(href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=#{ city.calendarUrl }&ctz=Europe/Athens") Public Google Calendar
          | &nbsp; for storing and reading the events and meetups.
        p What you need to do is create a new Calendar event from your Gmail account and invite the #{ city.hostname } Public Calendar:

        h2 Creating the Event
        h3 Event Name, Location, Time
        h4 Create a new event in your calendar. Use a short and descriptive name. Define the duration of the event.

        p In the <strong>Where</strong> field you need to enter a Google Maps resolvable address, meaning an address that Google Maps can resolve to a location.
        h5 A Good Address
        pre Mitropoleos 110, Thessaloniki, 54621, Greece
        h5 A Bad Address
        pre Mitropoleos 110, 2nd floor

        h3 The Event Description

        p The event description has a special role for the #{ city.hostname } website. It is used as the data entry field; The #{ city.hostname } engine will parse the description and look for specific keywords that will then use to render the event. The fields have a unique name and are separated using a colon from their values. Here are all the possible fields:
        ul
          li <strong>Venue:</strong> This is a free text field. It is the place you name a particular venue and any special instructions on where to find the meetup (i.e. 2nd floor, Office #3).
          li <strong>Info:</strong> This field expects a url that points to the events homepage.
          li <strong>Map:</strong> This field expects a Google Maps url that points directly to a Google Maps link with the exact location of the event.
          li <strong>About:</strong> A free text description of the event.
        p All of the above fields are optional, however, at least one has to be defined. Here's an example <em>Description</em> event field from the OpenThessaloniki event:
        pre Venue: 2nd Floor, Office 3<br>Info: http://www.openthessaloniki.org/<br>Map: https://www.google.com/maps?q=Ethnikis+Antistaseos+17,+Kalamaria,+Thessaloniki,+Greece&hl=en&sll=40.621193,22.954988&sspn=0.024365,0.039783&hnear=Leoforos+Ethnikis+Antistaseos+17,+Kalamaria,+Thessaloniki,+Greece&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A<br>About: A meetup about Open Data.

        h3 Inviting #{ city.hostname } Calendar

        p You need to paste the following email address in the "Add Guests" field and press the "Add" button:
        pre #{ city.calendarUrl }
        p We know this is hard to remember so if you are a frequent event organizer then it would make sense to create a new contact "#{ city.hostname } Calendar" and save the email there.
        p That was it, you can now <em>Save</em> the new event and as soon as we accept the invitation it will automatically be propagated to the live&nbsp;
          a(href="http://#{ city.hostname }") #{ city.hostname }
          | &nbsp; website.
