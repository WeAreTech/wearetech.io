        ## An impromptu FAQ

        ### How will the hackerspace sustain itself?

        We'll have the full set of co-working services offered to businesses and professionals, we'll also go for a small bar / refreshments commercial space. But in reality, the bulk of the space's yearly income will be from the member's subscriptions.

        ### Who is running the hackerspace?

        SKGTech along with the meetup communities of our city are the administrative entity. SKGTech is a Non Profit legal entity and will take care of all the accounting and legal work.
